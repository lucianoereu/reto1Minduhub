      <h4>IHF rules shall govern MDHL play except as modified herein</h4>
      <h3>SPORTSMANSHIP</h3>
      <p>
        The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
        youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
        coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
        detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless
        of technical hockey background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.
      </p>
      <h3>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>DIMENSIONS</b>IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field
          dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
          dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
          and older.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>COMPETITION FIELDS.</b>Fields used within the competition program
          must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations
          participating in the state competition program that are unable to
          provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the
          State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to
          inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver
          of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues,
          districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable
          field may be required to play all their games away.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</b>
          <ol class="subList">
            <li>
              U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
              areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.
            </li>
            <li>
              U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.
            </li>
            <li>
              U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in
              width.
            </li>
            <li>
              In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their
              internal dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>ALL-PLAY</h3>
      <p>
        All-play means that every recreation player on every team shall play
        atleast fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program
        are encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
            under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice
            and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and
            injuries.
